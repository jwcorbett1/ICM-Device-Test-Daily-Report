This Excel workbook uses named cells, Visual Basic, and Power Query to extract data from the Statewide ITS Device Test database.  It will only work with an active connection to the NCDOT network folder, which is only possible from an NCDOT workstation.  However, you can still examine how the code is put together and how the different systems within Excel interact with each other.
